a simple program displaying menu and letting user buy tickets

FIRST STAGE
Description
Good job: our friends really liked your program! Now they want to expand their theater and add screen rooms with more seats. However, this is expensive, so they want to make sure this will pay off. Help them calculate the profit from all the sold tickets depending on the number of available seats.

Objectives
In this stage, you need to read two positive integer numbers from the input: the number of rows and the number of seats in each row. The ticket price is determined by the following rules:

If the total number of seats in the screen room is not more than 60, then the price of each ticket is 10 dollars.
In a larger room, the tickets are 10 dollars for the front half of the rows and 8 dollars for the back half. Please note that the number of rows can be odd, for example, 9 rows. In this case, the first half is the first 4 rows, and the second half is the other 5 rows.
Calculate the profit from the sold tickets depending on the number of seats and print the result as shown in the examples below. After that, your program should stop. Note that in this project, the number of rows and seats won't be greater than 9.

THIRD STAGE 
Description
When choosing a ticket you are guided not only by your space preference but also by your finances. Let's implement the opportunity to check the ticket price and see the reserved seat.

Objectives
Read two positive integer numbers that represent the number of rows and seats in each row and print the seating arrangement like in the first stage. Then, read two integer numbers from the input: a row number and a seat number in that row. These numbers represent the coordinates of the seat according to which the program should print the ticket price. The ticket price is determined by the same rules as the previous stage:

If the total number of seats in the screen room is not more than 60, then the price of each ticket is 10 dollars.
In a larger room, the tickets are 10 dollars for the front half of the rows and 8 dollars for the back half. Please note that the number of rows can be odd, for example, 9 rows. In this case, the first half is the first 4 rows, and the second half is the last 5 rows.
After that, the program should print out all the seats in the screen room as shown in the example and mark the chosen seat by the B symbol. Finally, it should print the ticket price and stop. Note that in this project, the number of rows and seats won't be greater than 9.


FORTH STAGE
Description
The theatre is getting popular, and the customers started complaining that it's not practical that the program stops after buying one ticket. Let's add a menu that will allow them to buy tickets and display the current state of the seating arrangement when needed.

Objectives
At the start, your program should read two positive integer numbers that represent the number of rows and seats in each row. Then, it should print a menu with the following three items:

Show the seats should print the current seating arrangement. The empty seats should be marked with an S symbol, and taken seats are marked with a B symbol.
Buy a ticket should read the seat coordinates from the input and print the ticket price like in the previous stage. After that, the chosen seat should be marked with a B when the item Show the seats is called.
Exit should stop the program.


LAST STAGE
Description
Running a cinema theatre is no easy business. To help our friends, let's add statistics to your program. The stats will show the current income, total income, the number of available seats, and the percentage of occupancy.

In addition, our friends asked you to take care of a small inconvenience: it's not good when a user can buy a ticket that has already been purchased by another user. Let's fix this!

Objectives
Now your menu should look like this:

1. Show the seats
2. Buy a ticket
3. Statistics
0. Exit
When the item Statistics is chosen, your program should print the following information:

The number of purchased tickets;
The number of purchased tickets represented as a percentage. Percentages should be rounded to 2 decimal places;
Current income;
The total income that shows how much money the theatre will get if all the tickets are sold.
The rest of the menu items should work the same way as before, except the item Buy a ticket shouldn't allow a user to buy a ticket that has already been purchased.

If a user chooses an already taken seat, print That ticket has already been purchased! and ask them to enter different seat coordinates until they pick an available seat. Of course, you shouldn't allow coordinates that are out of bounds. If this happens, print Wrong input! and ask to enter different seat coordinates until the user picks an available seat.
